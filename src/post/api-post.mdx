Have you ever wondered how websites talk to each other? That’s what an **API** is for!

**API** stands for _Application Programming Interface_. It allows one application to talk to another—kind of like a digital waiter that delivers your request and brings back what you asked for.

### Why APIs Are Useful

- You can get real-time data like weather, jokes, or news.
- You don’t have to build everything yourself—just plug into an existing service.
- APIs let you connect with tools like Google Maps, Spotify, or OpenWeather.

### Quick Example in JavaScript

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
