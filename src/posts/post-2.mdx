When I first started learning React, `useState` and `useEffect` felt confusing. I wasn't sure when to use them or why class components weren't the default anymore.

But after building a few small apps, it finally *clicked*. I realized that hooks let you keep logic inside your components instead of splitting it up across lifecycle methods. Everything started to feel simpler and more modular.

Now I write most of my components as functions and use hooks to handle all the logic. It’s clean, readable, and powerful.

**What helped me most?**
- Actually using the hooks in small practice projects
- Reading the official [React Docs](https://react.dev/)
- Listening to episodes of the Syntax.fm podcast

Learning by doing made all the difference. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes while learning — every bug teaches you something new!
